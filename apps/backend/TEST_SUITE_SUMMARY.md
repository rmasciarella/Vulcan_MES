# Domain Services Unit Test Suite Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit test suite created for the domain services in the scheduling system.

## Test Files Created

### 1. ScheduleValidator Tests
**File**: `app/tests/domain/scheduling/services/test_schedule_validator.py`
- 25+ test methods covering all validation scenarios
- Precedence constraint validation, calendar constraints, resource conflicts
- Skill requirements, capacity constraints, task readiness validation
- Edge cases and integration scenarios

### 2. ResourceAllocationService Tests
**File**: `app/tests/domain/scheduling/services/test_resource_allocation_service.py`
- 35+ test methods covering allocation logic
- Resource matching algorithms, availability checking, cost optimization
- Skill-based allocation, load balancing, alternative resource finding
- Edge cases and realistic scenarios

### 3. CriticalSequenceManager Tests
**File**: `app/tests/domain/scheduling/services/test_critical_sequence_manager.py`
- 20+ test methods covering sequence analysis
- Critical path analysis, bottleneck identification, parallel execution planning
- Job prioritization, duration calculations, criticality scoring
- Complex workflow scenarios

### 4. Domain Events Tests
**File**: `app/tests/domain/scheduling/events/test_domain_events.py`
- 40+ test methods covering all event types and handlers
- Event creation, validation, immutability, handler patterns
- Event dispatching, error handling, integration workflows
- Task lifecycle, resource conflicts, maintenance scenarios

## Test Architecture

### Design Principles
- Test pyramid approach with comprehensive unit test coverage
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for clear test structure
- Behavior-driven testing focusing on business logic
- Deterministic tests with proper mocking and isolation

### Key Features
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- Realistic test data using factory patterns
- Edge case coverage including error conditions
- Integration scenarios for complex workflows
- Performance-optimized for fast feedback
