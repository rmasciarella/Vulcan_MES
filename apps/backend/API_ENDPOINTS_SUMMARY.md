# Production Scheduling API Endpoints

This document summarizes the HTTP API endpoints that have been created to expose the production scheduling functionality.

## API Structure

The scheduling API is organized into four main resource groups:

- **Jobs** (`/api/v1/scheduling/jobs`) - Job management and lifecycle
- **Schedules** (`/api/v1/scheduling/schedules`) - Schedule creation and optimization
- **Resources** (`/api/v1/scheduling/resources`) - Machine and operator management
- **Status** (`/api/v1/scheduling/status`) - Real-time monitoring and system status

## Authentication & Authorization

All endpoints use JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC):

- **Operator** - View-only access to jobs, schedules, and resources
- **Scheduler** - Create and manage jobs, create and optimize schedules
- **Manager** - Full CRUD operations, schedule publishing and management
- **Admin** - All permissions including resource management and system administration
