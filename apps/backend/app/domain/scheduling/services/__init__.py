"""
Domain Services

Contains domain services that encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally
belong to a single entity or value object. These services coordinate between
multiple domain objects and implement complex business operations.

Examples include scheduling algorithms, conflict resolution, and optimization
services that require coordination across multiple entities.
